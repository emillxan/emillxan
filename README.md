### 👨‍💻 About Me
5+ years building enterprise software. Working across the full cycle — from architecture to production.

Primary stack is C# and .NET ecosystem. But I work language-agnostic: if the task requires a different stack — I'll figure it out and ship it.

### 🌍 Open to
Remote opportunities with international companies. Flexible location and timezone.
